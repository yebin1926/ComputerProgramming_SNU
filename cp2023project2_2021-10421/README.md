1. 요구사항 14개 중 미구현 항목 명 및 이유:
   (영어 가능)
   I was able to implement all commands, however I am not 100% sure
   if they all work correctly.

2. 가장 어려웠던 기능 및 접근방법
The most challenging command to implement was load hot. 
I first had to decide whether I would want to use a file
to naviagte to the answer for "load_hot" or whether I would
just use a Map and a comparator to sort it. I ended up choosing
the latter, but I was relatively unfamiliar with the process of
creating comparators and overriding functions than other programming
problems, so it took me time to implement it.

3. 느낀점 (유익한 , 애로사항, 개선점, 등)
This was probably the most challenging project from this class.
I had so many questions and was very lost in the beginning, especially
since I had no background experience in HTML and how java files and HTML
files communicate with each other, and how google search apis work.
However, I do feel that this was a learning experience at the end and I
am satisfied with the outcome. I do feel that with more explanation and
run through of the new concepts and HTML programming would help.
